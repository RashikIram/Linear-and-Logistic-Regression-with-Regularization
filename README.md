# Linear-and-Logistic-Regression-with-Regularization

Implementation of Multivariate Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with L2 regularization using gradient descent, applied to the Air Quality and Smarket datasets. Model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and accuracy to analyze the impact of regularization on generalization.

This project explores how regularization techniques help reduce overfitting and improve model reliability. By applying real-world datasets—Air Quality and Smarket—we compare training and testing performance to highlight the trade-offs between model complexity and generalization.
